client_ajax_logger
==================

Sending client-side logs with ajax. Depends on [Console Proxy](https://github.com/bermi/console-proxy).

**It's library-agnostic.**


## Usage

Download source and add those scripts at the top of your HTML document (as first two scripts):

```
<script src="path_to_js/console-proxy.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="path_to_js/client_ajax_logger.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

* Change endpoint url in code
